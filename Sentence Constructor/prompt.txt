  </user:input>
  <assistant:output>
  Here’s your vocabulary table to help you form the sentence in Spanish:  

| Noun (sustantivo) | Verb (verbo) | Adverb (adverbio) | Adjective (adjetivo) |  
|------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
| hombre (man)     | ser (to be)   | por qué (why)     | ese (that)  |  
| playa (beach)    | correr (to run)  |                   |            |  

Now, let's break it down:  
- "Why" translates to **"por qué"**.  
- "Was" comes from the verb **"ser"** in the past tense.  
- "That man" uses **"ese"** as the adjective for "that."  
- "Running" comes from **"correr"**, but you need to put it in the correct past progressive or imperfect tense.  
- "On the beach" translates as **"en la playa."**  

Try putting it together! What's your attempt?
